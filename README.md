The Voice Based Automated Transport Enquiry system is a system that may provide information on the services provided by a certain transportation system, such as bus routes, passenger information, and so on.
This system accepts the voice input given by the user.
After recognising the voice command, the system interprets it and turns it into low-level instructions for retrieving data from the database.
The information is retrieved, read, and the output is supplied in the form of speech. 
The relevant data is also provided on the system screen, which includes many options for changing the query, adding new commands to the system, and editing the timing.
